why

1.
As we have seen recently, NFTs can be expensive. When they are too expensive, it's hard for a normal
person to own one. That's why we are introducing Fractional NFTs to Tron. You can now take for example
an expensive bored ape, and divide into fractions. The fractions can then be traded wherever you want!

2.
With this, you can also create something we like to call "NFT Index Funds". Imagine that you are the
fund manager, and you buy for example 5 bored apes, 5 crypto punks and 10 tronninjas. You can then 
fractionalize all of these NFTs, and sell the fractions to people that want exposure to your fund!
