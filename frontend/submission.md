1. Buy 1 or more NFTs on for example https://apenft.io.

3. Go to https://fractron.xyz/fractionalize and pick the NFTs you want to fractionalize, and then fractionalize.
4. You can now go to whatever DEX on tron you want, for example https://sunswap.io and add liquidity for your fractions, and then anyone can trade them!
